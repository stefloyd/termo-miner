Project Description: Smart Temperature Control System

The Smart Temperature Control System is a project aimed at providing an efficient and automated solution for controlling temperature-related processes, such as environmental temperature regulation or equipment cooling. The system utilizes an ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller along with various sensors and actuators to monitor and adjust temperature levels according to predefined thresholds and user preferences.

Key Features:

Temperature Sensing: The system employs a DS18B20 temperature sensor to accurately measure the ambient temperature in real-time.

Display Interface: An SSD1306 OLED display provides a user-friendly interface to visualize temperature readings, relay status, and operating mode.

Remote Control: Users can switch between local and remote control modes using dedicated push-buttons, allowing for manual intervention or automated operation via a remote interface.

Relay Control: A relay module is utilized to control external devices such as cooling fans or heating elements based on temperature thresholds and user commands.

Web Interface: The system features a web server running on the ESP8266 microcontroller, enabling users to monitor temperature data, adjust settings, and control the system remotely via a web browser interface.

How It Works:

The DS18B20 temperature sensor continuously monitors the ambient temperature, which is displayed on the OLED screen in real-time. Users can interact with the system using physical push-buttons to switch between local and remote control modes or toggle relay states.

In local control mode, the system autonomously adjusts the relay state based on predefined temperature thresholds, activating or deactivating connected devices such as cooling fans to maintain the desired temperature range. In remote control mode, users can access the web interface hosted by the ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor temperature data, adjust settings, and control the system remotely from any internet-connected device.

Applications:

The Smart Temperature Control System finds applications in various scenarios, including:

Home automation for regulating room temperature and humidity levels.
Greenhouse automation for optimizing plant growth conditions.
Industrial automation for controlling equipment cooling systems.
Server room monitoring and temperature control for maintaining optimal operating conditions.
Conclusion:

The Smart Temperature Control System offers an intelligent and flexible solution for temperature control applications, combining the versatility of the ESP8266 microcontroller with the precision of temperature sensing technology. Whether for home, greenhouse, or industrial use, the system provides an efficient way to monitor, manage, and automate temperature-related processes, enhancing comfort, efficiency, and productivity.
